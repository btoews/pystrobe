#pystrobe.py -- a python strobelight!!!#

Written with curses to act as a [dream-machine](http://lmgtfy.com)... 
Also uses pyaudio to generate binaural beats at the same frequency.
It takes the audio a few secods to catch up after starting the video
or changing frequency.

This projects depends on curses and pyaudio.
