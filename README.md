Written with curses to act as a [dream-machine](http://lmgtfy.com)... 
Also uses pyaudio to generate [binaural beats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats) at the same frequency.
It takes the audio a few secods to catch up after starting the video
or changing frequency.

This projects depends on curses and pyaudio.
